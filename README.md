## What is KiwiSrc?
### KiwiSrc is a small project with the goal of providing a modernized version of source SDK, It is based on both Mapbase and Source SDK 2013 Community Edition. 

## Why dose this exist?
### Personaly i like the mapping system used in hammer and overall BSP. I also love the source engine, This lead to the creation of KiwiSRc.


# Installation
## Windows
Installation on windows is almost identicle to any other version of SDK2013. Clone of repo:
Install GIT/GITHUB
Open CMD (not in Admin)
Type "Git Clone https://github.com/Bradleyp123/KiwSrc-Ultimate.git"
Wait for the command to finish.
Done!!!
Happy Modding my fellow Internet Dweller!
