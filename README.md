Custom version of Source Engine, based on Mapbase and SDK 2013 CE.

Kiwi Source (KiwiSrc) is a custom built version of Valves Source®️ Engine, It is based on both Mapbase (all code excluding KiwiSrc, Material System and VRAD) and Source SDK 2013 Community Edition. 

KiwiSrc's goal is to create a "Semi-Modern" version of Source engine. This means improved VRAD, Improved Randering, More reliance on GPU and memory and a host of other improvements. This isn't ment to be the engine the next TitanFall runs on nor will it be, it is for the community by the community.

NOTES:
No MP, Issues with and BSP-Debug
